## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.7] - 2022-12-01
### Fixed
- `python3` base image has now `git` and `build-essential` installed (again).
- User-defined requirements, coming from `python3` jobs,
  are better isolated from the core fatman dependencies to avoid conflicts.

## Older versions
Older changes are included in the [Racetrack's Changelog](https://github.com/TheRacetrack/racetrack/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md)
when `python3` wrapper was part of the Racetrack repository.
